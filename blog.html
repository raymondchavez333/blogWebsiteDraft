                Life is a marathon and not a race
            </div>

            <p>
                When I was still a little kid, I thought that life is a race and I should start to acquire things early because if not I will become a failure. I was raised by mom most of the time because my father is an ofw and she keeps on telling me to get the best in everything. She is the one who teaches me to always hurry because if I don't then someone else will get it. 
                During my childhood years, I was spending most of my time only inside the house just to study with my tutor. So Academically speaking, I really wanted to get the best grades even if I don't really learn that much because if only I get good marks on exams then I would be able to play outside. 
                <br><br>Fast forward starting grade 2 until I graduated senior high school I was a consistent honor student but college came and it took a great hit to all of my expectations in life. I took up computer science and struggled through that course and couldn’t handle even a simple programming task. 
                This became one of the darkest days of my life because it was my dream degree and career but every single day that passed, I just kept getting low marks and couldn’t keep up in the class. 
                <br><br>Then I went to engineering not because I hated computer science but because the dean of the College of Computer Studies told me to shift because I was really weak at math and they couldn’t offer summer classes for classes that I failed. So, I was running this kind of race that I have set on my mind but the twist is that I didn’t have a proper map to reach the destination.
                Then I went to Information Technology, take note that this is the second time that I shifted and is my current degree as of September 2025. Now I feel like I have found what really works for me, although this was not my first choice, yet this is the right one for me. 
                <br><br>To sum it up, life is not a race, rather it is a marathon wherein you will have many turns and  change of directions.

                Doing what you don't like leads to growth
            </div>

            <p>
                <br><br>Reading the title could make you feel uncomfortable but please hear me out, this is not to discourage you to not do what you really want but to remind you that if you ever want to pursue something, you have to do what it takes to get it and part of it is doing the unlikable ones. 
                When we look around us, for example plants, they can never grow if they do not receive enough sunlight and water. Water feels nourishing  yet the scorching heat of the sun is painful but plants by nature can’t hide and even if they do, they can not grow and will soon die if they refuse to receive the light coming from the sun. 
                <br><br>It is also the same to us, yes doing what we like is very much important but to grow properly, we also need to do the things which we don’t like. What are the things that we don’t like? These are the household chores, spending extra time for studying, practicing the craft that we always want to improve at and many more. 
                There is a quote that says “Everyone wants to be a winner, but not everyone is willing to do what it takes to become one”. The quote hits like a truck because this is the reality in our society today. Even just waking up early and not being late to classes and appointments feels impossible sometimes because we don’t like to wake up early and will likely spend more minutes or hours sleeping. 
                <br><br>Now I have shown some scenarios to prevent you from misleading the title, let’s now proceed to steps on how to do the unlikable tasks. It is just repetition, just do it even if it feels bad. Remember the times you spent gaming or other leisure activities and you don’t feel any guilt doing it? Then just apply it but this time for productive outputs. 
                Don’t force yourself too much, even if it is a little bit of time just do it and once you did it, don’t forget to reward yourself. When the time comes, you will appreciate how doing this leads to growth and change in your life.

                Failure is the greatest teacher
            </div>
            <img alt="failed man" src="blogPage/images/failure.jpg">
            <p>
                <br><br>Many of us don’t like to get failing grades in an exam, losing in sports or games, and not reaching the success we always wanted to achieve. There are just some of the failures that I’ve been through but I know there are thousands of variations which we encounter in our life. Before I always thought that if I studied hard, then I would likely get the best grades that I like but it doesn’t work like that.

                <br><br>There are reasons why failure exists and our life because without it, how can we truly learn? As a student I thought that just merely familiarizing or memorizing definitions and formulas are the key to achieve high grades but little did I know that I’m missing the point of education. Education is there to help us to think, ask and find solutions to problems that were assigned to us or even problems we encounter in our life. 
                Starting highschool, I’m really afraid that if I fail a quiz or a subject, then my whole life also ends. I only see failure as the end without any continuation. But things changed when I entered college. College was tough and it feels like I’m in a pressure cooker every single day. My memorizing techniques were all useless because each problem given by the teacher requires analysis and logical creativity. I started to get lower grades and failed subjects, most of them are the major ones. 

                <br><br>One day, I was researching on the internet on learning to program, then I went through a lesson which talks about having a growth mindset. The article is based on a book named “Mindset: The New Psychology of Success” authored by Carol Dweck. After reading the article and the book, failure depends entirely on how we see it, do we see it negatively or positively. Do we think that learning is just for the smart and if we didn’t get it, then we are just born dumb?
                Do we think that everything is just about talent and hard work doesn’t play a major role? When I asked myself those questions, I started to realize that it is not too late to improve and if I wanted to get good at something I just had to put in the extra time and work to achieve it. Maybe now is the time to ask yourself these questions and see the effect it will bring to your life.
